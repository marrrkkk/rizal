# CORS Error Fix Guide

## Problem

The Rizal app is getting CORS errors when trying to connect to the PHP API backend:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost/rizal/api/progress/get_progress.php' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Automatic Fallback System âœ…

- The app now automatically falls back to localStorage when the API is unavailable
- Progress is still saved and tracked locally
- All game functionality continues to work
- A status indicator shows when running in "offline mode"

### 2. Debug Tools âœ…

- Created `debug-api.html` - Open this file in your browser to test API connectivity
- Enhanced logging in the console to show what's happening
- Connection status indicator in the top-right corner of the app

## How to Fix the CORS Issue

### Option 1: Start Your PHP Server (Recommended)

1. **Make sure XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP is running**

   ```bash
   # Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
   ```

2. **Verify the backend files are in the right location**

   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\rizal\api\
   ```

3. **Test the server connection**
   - Open `debug-api.html` in your browser
   - Click "Test Connection" button
   - Should show "Server is working!" if successful

### Option 2: Fix PHP Configuration

If the server is running but CORS still fails, add this to your `.htaccess` file in the `rizal` directory:

```apache
# .htaccess file in C:\xampp\htdocs\rizal\
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "false"

# Handle preflight requests
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]
```

### Option 3: Use Different Port

If localhost conflicts, try:

1. Change XAMPP Apache port to 8080
2. Update API_BASE_URL in `src/utils/progressAPI.js`:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/rizal/api";
   ```

### Option 4: Use the Fallback Mode (Current Solution)

The app is now working with localStorage fallback! You can:

- Continue using the app normally
- All progress is saved locally
- Fix the server connection later when convenient

## Testing Your Fix

### 1. Use the Debug Tool

1. Open `debug-api.html` in your browser
2. Test each step:
   - Connection test
   - Login test
   - Progress API test

### 2. Check the App

1. Look for the status indicator in the top-right corner
2. If it shows "ðŸ“± Offline Mode" - the fallback is working
3. If it disappears - the API connection is working!

### 3. Console Logs

Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:

- âœ… "Successfully loaded progress from API" (API working)
- ðŸ’¾ "Using localStorage completion..." (Fallback working)

## Current Status

âœ… **App is fully functional** - All games work, progress is saved
âœ… **Automatic fallback** - No user intervention needed
âœ… **Debug tools available** - Easy to test and fix
âœ… **Status indicator** - Users know what's happening

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use**: The app works perfectly with localStorage fallback
2. **For full functionality**: Fix the PHP server connection using the steps above
3. **For testing**: Use `debug-api.html` to verify your fixes

## Files Modified

- âœ… `src/hooks/useProgressAPI.js` - Added fallback logic
- âœ… `src/utils/progressFallback.js` - localStorage progress management
- âœ… `src/components/ConnectionStatus.jsx` - Status indicator
- âœ… `src/App.jsx` - Added connection status display
- âœ… `debug-api.html` - Debug tool for testing API
- âœ… `CORS_FIX_GUIDE.md` - This guide

The app is now resilient and will work regardless of server status! ðŸŽ‰
