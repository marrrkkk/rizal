- **Achievement Progress**: Tracking toward next badges
- **Celebration System**: Recognition of milestones and accomplishments

## üéÆ Game Integration

### Analytics Tracking in Games:

- **Level Start Tracking**: Automatic tracking when games begin
- **Interaction Tracking**: Detailed logging of user interactions
- **Performance Metrics**: Score, attempts, hints, time tracking
- **Mini-game Analytics**: Individual game component performance

### Example Integration (JoseBirthGame):

```javascript
// Track level start
useEffect(() => {
  trackLevelStart(1, 1);
}, [trackLevelStart]);

// Track mini-game completion
trackInteraction(1, 1, "mini_game_complete", {
  gameIndex: currentGame,
  score: score,
  attempts: attempts,
  hintsUsed: hintsUsed,
});
```
