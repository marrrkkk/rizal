  completeLevel, // Complete a level function
  exportProgress, // Export to file
  importProgress, // Import from file
  isLevelUnlocked, // Check if level is unlocked
  getAllBadges, // Get all earned badges
} = useUserProgress(username);
```

### Data Structure

Each user's progress includes:

```javascript
{
  username: "student_name",
  userId: "student_name",
  createdAt: "2025-01-09T...",
  lastSaved: "2025-01-09T...",
  lastAccessed: "2025-01-09T...",
  chapters: {
    1: {
      unlockedLevels: [1, 2, 3],
      completedLevels: [1, 2],
      scores: { 1: 85, 2: 92 },
      badges: ["chapter_1_complete"],
      timeSpent: 1200,        // seconds
      attempts: { 1: 1, 2: 2 }
    }
    // ... chapters 2-5
  },
  overall: {
    totalLevelsCompleted: 10,
    averageScore: 88,
    totalTimeSpent: 3600,
    badges: ["first_level_complete", "knowledge_seeker"],
    achievements: {
      perfectScores: 3,
      consecutiveDays: 5,
      streakRecord: 7
    },
    statistics: {
      gamesPlayed: 15,
      averageTimePerLevel: 180,
      favoriteChapter: 2,
      strongestSubject: 1
    }
  }
}
```

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage in Components

```javascript
import { useUserProgress } from "../hooks/useUserProgress";

function GameComponent({ username }) {
  const { completeLevel, isLevelUnlocked } = useUserProgress(username);

  const handleGameComplete = async (score, timeSpent) => {
    const result = await completeLevel(1, 1, score, timeSpent);
    if (result.success) {
      console.log("Level completed!", result.newBadges);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isLevelUnlocked(1, 2) ? (
        <button onClick={() => startLevel(1, 2)}>Play Level 2</button>
      ) : (
        <p>Complete Level 1 first!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Admin Dashboard Usage

```javascript
import { useMultiUserProgress } from "../hooks/useUserProgress";

function AdminView() {
  const { users, getTopPerformers } = useMultiUserProgress();
  const topStudents = getTopPerformers("completionPercentage", 5);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Top Performers</h2>
      {topStudents.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.username}>
          {user.username}: {user.completionPercentage}% complete
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üíæ File Management

### Automatic File Naming

Progress files are automatically named using the pattern:

```
rizal_progress_[username]_[date].json
```

Example: `rizal_progress_john_doe_2025-01-09.json`

### File Operations

- **Export**: Creates downloadable JSON file with complete progress data
- **Import**: Validates and loads progress from JSON file
- **Backup**: Automatic localStorage backup with every save
- **Cross-Platform**: Files work across different devices and browsers

## üèÜ Enhanced Badge System

### New Badges

- **Efficiency Master**: Complete 5+ levels with average time < 2 minutes
- **Persistent Learner**: Complete a level after 3+ attempts
- **Marathon Learner**: 30 consecutive days of play
- **Speed Runner**: 5 levels completed in one session

### Badge Categories

- **Progress Badges**: Level and chapter completion
- **Performance Badges**: Perfect scores and high averages
- **Dedication Badges**: Consecutive days and persistence
- **Milestone Badges**: Major achievements and expertise

## üìä Statistics Tracked

### Per User

- Total levels completed
- Average score across all games
- Total time spent learning
- Number of badges earned
- Current and longest streak
- Favorite chapter (most time spent)
- Strongest subject (highest average score)
- Games played and attempts made

### System-Wide (Admin View)

- Total registered users
- Average completion percentage
- Total badges awarded
- Total learning time across all users
